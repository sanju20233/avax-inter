# Solidity Contract Function ErrorHandling

This Solidity contract example demonstrates the usage of `require()`, `assert()`, and `revert()` statements in a smart contract. The purpose of this contract is to showcase how these statements can be used for validation and error handling within a contract.

## Description

This contract, named `ContractExample`, maintains a `balance` variable that represents an account balance. It provides two external functions: `deposit()` and `withdraw()`. The `deposit()` function allows users to add funds to the `balance`, while the `withdraw()` function allows users to withdraw funds from the `balance`. 

The `require()` statement is used to validate that the input parameters meet certain conditions. It ensures that the `amount` provided in the `deposit()` and `withdraw()` functions is greater than zero and does not exceed the available `balance`. If these conditions are not met, an error message is returned.

The `assert()` statement is used to check for internal errors or contract invariant violations. In this contract, it is used to verify that the `balance` is correctly updated after a deposit and withdrawal. If the `assert()` condition fails, it indicates a critical error in the contract execution.

The `revert()` statement is used to revert the transaction and provide a revert message. In the `withdraw()` function, it is used to revert the transaction if the requested withdrawal amount is zero.

## Getting Started

To execute and interact with this contract, you can use a Solidity development environment such as Remix. Follow the steps below to get started:

1. Go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.
2. Create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar.
3. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., ContractExample.sol).
4. Copy and paste the provided Solidity code into the file.
5. Compile the code by clicking on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.0" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile ContractExample.sol" button.
6. Once the code is compiled successfully, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "ContractExample" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.
7. After the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the `deposit()` and `withdraw()` functions. Use appropriate parameters and click on the "transact" button to execute the functions.
